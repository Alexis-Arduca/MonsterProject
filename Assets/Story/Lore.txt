Welcome to the Monster Laboratory, a vast glass dome suspended in the heavens.
Inside this dome lie three distinct biomes, each with its own unique environment, specially designed to suit the needs of the creatures within.
Each biome is home to two different monsters, carefully chosen to match the specific characteristics of their habitat.
These monsters are protected species, and the laboratory serves as a sanctuary where they can live safely and peacefully.
Your mission is to explore these biomes, meet the monsters, and learn more about their mysterious nature.
